          <h3>Artifact 1: Qing Dynasty Covered Baluster Vase</h3>
          <p>
            This covered baluster vase is part of a five-piece garniture from
            the Qing dynasty, dating from the Kangxi reign (1662-1722). It is
            crafted from white porcelain with cobalt pigment under a clear
            glaze. The vase features a painted scene of a court lady being
            entertained by dancers and musicians, with floral decorations on the
            neck and a domed cover adorned with ladies, flowers, and rocks.
            Originally part of a collection owned by Mrs. B.F. Jones, it was
            gifted to the Freer Gallery of Art in 1980 by Myron S. Falk, Jr. and
            his sisters.
